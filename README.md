## Introduction
This project work helps to detect Bank fraud by using given data. Supervised Machine learning algorithms was used to detect fraudulent behavior based upon past fraud as indicated in the “label” column, and the use of unsupervised Machine learning algorithms was employed to discover new types of fraud activities. Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to the norm. Hence, imbalanced datasets was properly classified. The project work provides technical insights and demonstrates the implementation of fraud detection models.
## Data Description
The dataset consists of 37 columns and 190001 rows with the “label” column as its target column.
## Approach 
For this project work, all necessary Python libraries, modules and dataset were first imported, and then followed by data visualization. Preprocessing and EDA was carried out before the models were built. Evaluation metrics as well such as precision, recall, and f1 score for all the models were also done. The whole code was written in both Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab
## Algorithms 
As I mentioned earlier, I have used various classification models on this dataset and they have different accuracy and other performance measures. The following machine learning algorithms are used on the dataset:
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree 
3. Logistic Regression
4. K-Nearest Neighbor
5. SVM
6. XGBoost
